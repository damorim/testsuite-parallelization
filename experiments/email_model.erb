<%# Subject: Question on parallel testing: person.project.name %>
<%# To: <%= person.email %>
Dear <%= person.name %>,

*Please, ignore this e-mail if you already answered it!*

I'm a developer and researcher in Software Engineering interested in
running integration tests faster. We analyzed a large set of projects
hosted at GitHub and noticed that you contribute to the project
<%= person.project.name %> (<%= person.project.url %>) that uses
Maven Surefire for testing.

I would like if you could take 2-3 minutes (estimated time)
to answer the following questions, it would help us a lot.

1) How long does it take (average) for tests to run in your
environment?  Can you briefly define your setup?

2) Do you confirm that you project does *not* run tests in parallel?

3) Select a reason for no not using parallelization

 a) I did not know it was possible;
 b) I was concerned with concurrency issues;
 c) I use a continuous integration server;
 d) Some other reason.  Please elaborate.

Your participation in the survey is voluntary and all of your
responses will be kept confidential. No personally identifiable
information will be associated with your responses in reported data.

Sincerely,
