Subject: Survey of parallel testing 
To: <%= email %>

I am writing to you to request your participation in a brief survey. 
We downloaded your java open-source project from GitHub (<%= link %>) and noticed that your project in 01/01/2016 had a Maven Surefire enabled test environment. We would like to get more information about these tests you wrote. Your responses to this survey will help us evaluate the effectiveness of the parallel automatic testing so that we can understand better which situation is better to use the parallel testing in Maven projects.

The survey is very brief and will only take about 5 minutes to complete. 

1) Does your project really do not use parallel testing?

2) Why do you not use parallel testing with Maven?

a) I did not know it was possible
b) Concurrency problems
c) I have a powerfull computer
d) I only run the tests sometimes

3) If you do not use parallelism, what do you do instead?

Please reply this e-mail with the answers. 
Your participation in the survey is completely voluntary and all of your responses will be kept confidential. No personally identifiable information will be associated with your responses to any reports of these data. 

Sincerely,
