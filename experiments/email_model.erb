Subject: Question on parallel testing : <%= projectName %>
To: <%= email %>

Dear <%= personName %>,

I am part of a research group that is highly interested in
understanding how software engineers accelerate test execution.  We
analyzed a large set of projects on github (using its public API) and
noticed that the project <%= projectName %> (which you appear as a
member) uses Maven Surefire test environment.  Additionally, we noticed
that, although tests take a fair amount of time to execute (>3m in our
environment), we could not find evidence in your pom.xml of usage of
parallelization in test execution (e.g. fork jvm).  We would
appreciate tremendously if you could kindly take 2-3 minutes
(estimated time) to answer this very short survey.

1) How long does it take (average) for tests to run in your
environment?  Can you briefly define your setup?

2) Do you confirm that you project does *not* run tests in parallel?

3) Select a reason for no not using parallelization

 a) I did not know it was possible
 b) I was concerned with concurrency issues (e.g., interference caused by dependent tests)
 c) I have a powerful computer
 d) I only run tests sometimes
 e) I use a continuous integration server (e.g., Travis)
 f) Some other reason.  Please elaborate.

Your participation in the survey is voluntary and all of your
responses will be kept confidential. No personally identifiable
information will be associated with your responses to any reports of
these data.

Sincerely, 
<%= name %>
<%= desc %>
UFPE
