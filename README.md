# Study on Test Suite Parallelization in Open Source Projects

This repository is dedicated to our study on low-level parallelism (ie,
parallism provided by testing frameworks and build systems) in Open Source Projects.

Artifacts directories (eg, ase17-artifacts) are git submodules. A git submodule
is an independent repositories with their own commit history. By default, these projects are not cloned.
To fully clone this repository (files from this repository + submodules) use `git clone --recursive`
