\section{Evaluation}

We pose the following research questions:

\subsection{Subjects}
\label{sec:subjects}

We used the Github's Search API to fetch the top 1.000 projects in
Java with at least 100 stars. The number of stars indicates the
interest and appreciation from the community to a project.
\Comment{(https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars/)} Although our
criteria is subjective, it is an approximation for relevant projects
to conduct our study. From the 1.000 downloaded projects, \Fix{N}
compiled.  \Fix{...}
