%% . which can disrupt the development
%% process~\cite{hilton-etal-ase2016}.\Comment{  This is often referred to as the
%% ``regression testing problem''.}

As software evolves it is expected that the number of tests and the
length of test runs increase.  Both components can add up to the
aggregate cost of running a test suite.  Dealing with high testing
costs is an important problem in software engineering research and
practice (as to reduce late test failure reports).

Several approaches have been proposed in the research literature to
address the regression testing problem, with the focus mainly on test
suite minimization, prioritization, reduction, and
selection~\cite{yoo-harman-stvr2012}.  In industry, the focus has been
mainly on distributing the testing workloads.  Evidence of this are
the Google TAP system~\cite{google-tap,google-ci} and Microsoft's
CloudBuild system~\cite{prasad-shulte-ieee-microsoft-ci}, which
provide distributed infrastructures to efficienctly build massive
amounts of code and run tests.  Building server clusters is also a
popular mechanism to distribute testing workloads.  For example, as of
August 2013, the Groupon PWA system, which powers the
\url{groupon.com} website, included over 19K tests.  To run all those
tests under 10m, Groupon used a cluster of 4 computers with 24 cores
each~\cite{kim-etal-fse2013}.

At large organizations, the alternative of renting cloud
services\footnote{List of popular cloud services:
  \url{https://clutch.co/cloud}} or even building proprietary
infrastructures for running tests is a legitimate approach to mitigate
the regression testing problem.  However, for projects with low
budgets and yet relatively heavy testing workloads, this solution may
not be economically viable.  This paper reports on a study we
conducted analyzing three orthogonal dimensions of regression testing
in open-source projects.  We argue that this an important problem
given the tremendous popularity of open-source development and
regression testing research.  The dimensions of analysis are as
follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevalence of long-running test suites.}
\item \textbf{Usage of test suite parallelization.}  
\item \textbf{Impact (and issues) of parallelization.}  
\end{itemize}

%% \Mar{Ask Milos if he can share stories on how prevalent regression
%%   testing is at Microsoft and Google, if he can explain how they run
%%   tests, and how prevalent is parallelization (in contrast to
%%   regression testing).}

%Motivated by this potential gap in regression testing,

%% RQ1 + RQ2
To assess how prevalent long-running test suites are in open-source
projects, we selected \numSubjs{} popular Java projects from \github{}
containing Maven build files~\cite{maven}.  (Section~\ref{sec:eval}
details our selection methodology.)  To run each test suite, we used a
16GB memory Intel i7 machine\Comment{ i7-4790 Intel processor} with
eight virtual CPUs (four cores with two native threads each) and the
default Maven configuration of each project.  Our results indicate
that \percentMedLongRunning{} of the test suites take at least 1m to
run and nearly 8\% of the test suites take more than 5m to run.
Including medium and long-running test suites ($>$1m), a test suite
takes \averageMedLongRunning{} to run, on average.  These results
indicate that open-source projects often contain long running test
suites.  Furthermore, we found that although \Fix{...time

\Mar{missing connection. why parallelism?}  From these results we
investigated (2) how frequently the projects we considered use
parallelization to speedup test runs.  Our results indicate that
\percentParallelForLongRunning{} of long-running test suites do use
parallelism to speedup execution.  Given the popularity of this
solution, we further studied: (3) what are the causes of high
execution cost in individual tests (CPU vs. IO) and (4) how uniformly
cost is distributed across tests.  These questions help to assess the
impact of parallelization in test suite execution.  Intuitively,
IO-intensive test suites and test suites with uneven distribution of
cost per test are factors that limit the benefits of parallelization.
Results indicate that \Fix{...}  Finally, we investigated (5) what are
the limitations related to parallelization that could justify adoption
resistance.
