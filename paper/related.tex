Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to optimize
regression testing.  Research has focused mostly on test suite
minimization, prioritization, reduction, and
selection~\cite{yoo-harman-stvr2012}.  Most of these techniques are
unsound (\ie{}, they do not guarantee that fault-revealing tests will
be selected), however, more recently, sound techniques have been
proposed~\cite{gligoric-etal-issta2015,soetens-etal-2016}.  For
example, to soundly select tests for execution,
Ekstazi\cite{ekstazi-web,gligoric-etal-issta2015} conservatively
computes which tests have been impacted by changes.  A test is
discarded for execution if it does not depend on any changed file.
Similar approach to regression test selection has been recently
applied in the context of the GCC~\cite{gcc} configurable
system~\cite{souto-damorim-jss}.

\Fix{elaborate...}As another example, a recent paper from the
automotive industry reported that test suites can take days to
run~\cite{artl-etal-icst2015}.
